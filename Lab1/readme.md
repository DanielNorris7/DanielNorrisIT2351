# Creating a Database from a Script

### Executive Summary
Installed MySQL Server and Workbench to be able to create the NorthWinds database.

### Creating a Database From a Script
The first step in the process was to run the installer for MySQL. Once the installation was completed, I created a sql connection to the database server. After the connection was made I was able to open a query window to create the new database. 

### Retrieving Data From Two or More Tables
Inner joins returns records when the condition is met from both tables. Outer joins return recods from the specificed side of the table when the conditions are meant from the opposing side. 

### Conclusion
This was a good lab. You needed to think about the data that you were trying to return and had to pay attention to the foreign and primary keys. The one thing I would recommend improving for furture itterations is better instructions on installing MySQL for the first time.
